- b. Verify if the HTTP response is 200 OK.
- c. Confirm that the returned port list has exactly 10 elements
- d. Ensure the first port in the list is 'Port90' and the last one is 'Port99'

### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria

This test passes by meeting the following criteria:

- Querying a port list with the specified correct parameters in each step:
      - A 200 OK HTTP response.
      - The correct number of ports is returned.
      - The first and last ports in the list is as expected according to the parameters.

- Querying a port list with the specified incorrect parameters, such as negative indexes or out of range indexes, results in a BAD_REQUEST.

- Querying bridge_normal with pagination parameters returns a 400 BAD_REQUEST

#### Test fail criteria

This test fails when:

- Querying a port list with the specified correct parameters in each step:
      - A 200 OK HTTP response is not received.
      - An incorrect number of ports is returned.
      - The first and last ports in the list are not as expected according to the parameters.

- Querying a port list with the specified incorrect parameters, such as negative indexes or out of range indexes, results in anything other than BAD_REQUEST.

- Querying bridge_normal with pagination parameters returns anything other than BAD_REQUEST


## Sort ports by field

### Objective

This test case verifies if the port list retrieved is sorted by a field.

### Requirements

Period after exist
Depth is set to 1 in all queries

        "admin": "up"
    },
    "referenced_by": [{"uri": "/rest/v1/system/bridges/bridge_normal"}]
}
```

### Description

Allowed sort fields:
```
name
interfaces
trunks
ip4_address
ip4_address_secondary
lacp
bond_mode
tag
vlan_mode
mac
bond_active_slave
ip6_address
ip6_address_secondary
admin
```

Sort by allowed sort field (ascending mode)

For each allowed sort field exececute the following steps:
1. Execute a GET request on /rest/v1/system/ports?depth=1;sort={field_name} and verify that response is 200 OK.
2. Verify if the result is being ordered by the provided field name

Sort by allowed sort field (descending mode)

For each allowed sort field exececute the following steps:
1. Execute a GET request on /rest/v1/system/ports?depth=1;sort=-{field_name} and verify that response is 200 OK.
2. Verify if the result is being ordered by the provided field name

### Test result criteria

#### Test pass criteria

This test passes by meeting the following criteria:

- The HTTP response is 200 OK.
- The response has 10 ports
- The ports are sorted ascending/descending by the field name

#### Test fail criteria

This test fails when:

- The HTTP response is not equal to 200 OK.
- The response doesn't have 10 ports
- The port aren't sorted ascending/descending by the field name


## Sort ports by field combination

### Objective

This test case verifies if the port list retrieved is sorted ascending/descending by a combination of fields.

}
```
The admin field of each port has the following values:
```
Port1: 	 admin = "up"
Port2: 	 admin = "down"
Port3: 	 admin = "up"
Port4: 	 admin = "down"
Port5: 	 admin = "up"
Port6: 	 admin = "down"
Port7: 	 admin = "up"
Port8: 	 admin = "down"
Port9: 	 admin = "up"
Port10:	 admin = "down"
```

### Description
Sort by admin and name (Ascending mode)

1. Execute a GET request on /rest/v1/system/ports?depth=1;sort=admin,name and verify that response is 200 OK.
2. Verify if the result is being ordered by the provided fields. First by admin and the by name.

Sort by admin and name (Descending mode)

1. Execute a GET request on /rest/v1/system/ports?depth=1;sort=-admin,name and verify that response is 200 OK.
2. Verify if the result is being ordered by the provided fields. First by admin and the by name.

### Test result criteria

#### Test pass criteria

This test passes by meeting the following criteria:

- The HTTP response is 200 OK.
- The response has 10 ports
- The result is sorted ascending/descending by the combination of fields

Expected result when sort mode is ascending:
```
admin = down, name = Port10
admin = down, name = Port2
admin = down, name = Port4
admin = down, name = Port6
admin = down, name = Port8
admin = up, name = Port1
admin = up, name = Port3
admin = up, name = Port5
admin = up, name = Port7
admin = up, name = Port9
```

Expected result when sort mode is descending:
```
admin = up, name = Port9
admin = up, name = Port7
admin = up, name = Port5
admin = up, name = Port3
admin = up, name = Port1
admin = down, name = Port8
admin = down, name = Port6
admin = down, name = Port4
admin = down, name = Port2
admin = down, name = Port10
```

#### Test fail criteria

The test fails when:

- The HTTP response is not 200 OK.
- The response doesn't have 10 ports
- The result is not sorted ascending/descending by the combination of fields
