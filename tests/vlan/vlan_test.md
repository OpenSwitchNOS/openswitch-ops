##  VLAN_state_reason_transition ##
### Objective ###
With several VLANs configured, bring one VLAN up and confirm its state, witch one port assigned to it verify its the VLAN Reason state for that VLAN transitions from no_member_port  ok.  Then administratively disable the VLAN and note the VLAN Status state transition from up to down. State changes should only occur on the VLAN being modified.

#### Test Fail Criteria ####
If more than one VLAN was configured with same options or the VLAN being modified changes to an incorrect state.

##  VLAN_removed_from_end_of_table ##
### Objective ###

### Test Result Criteria ###
#### Test Pass Criteria ####
VLAN is correctly deleted without affecting the other ones, and traffic is correctly sent.
#### Test Fail Criteria ####
Other VLAN were affected with traffic sent and or target VLAN was not correctly deleted.

##  VLAN_removed_from_middle_of_table ##
### Objective ###
Verify the functionality of deleting a VLAN and reasigned port to another VLAN. The VLAN will be deleted from middle of the VLAN list or the VLAN not with the highest or lowest VID. No traffic should pass through other VLANs.

### Requirements ###
The requirements for this test case are:

 - OpenSwitch OS
 - Ubuntu or CentOS for workStations with nmap installed
