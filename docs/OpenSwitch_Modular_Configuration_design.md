## High level design of OpenSwitch Modular Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------
OpenSwitch Modular Configuration allows users to carry out build time
customization of OpenSwitch image. Features can be enabled/disabled and
parameters can be changed via the framework resulting in customized OpenSwitch
image.

To provide a bird's eye view, design of Modular Configuration framework can be
classified into four categories. Details are covered in following sections:

* Kconfig system which handles the configuration front-end providing a UI for
  user interaction
* A set of scripts running under Yocto build infrastructure which converts
  configuration options generated by Kconfig system into something Yocto can
  understand
* Enhancements to OpenSwitch schema which helps scripts to identify and prune
  schema entries related to disabled features
* Enhancements to CIT framework which helps to identify and exclude tests
  related to disabled features

```

## Participating modules
------------------------
### Kconfig System
------------------
Kconfig front-end system is pulled into OpenSwitch Yocto build environment,
built and executed as part of a new make target "make menuconfig". Recipe
kconfig-frontends.bb is involved in this process. Since front-end is run on
the native/host system, native version of the recipe is used.

Kconfig system parses provided Kconfig files, works out all feature dependencies
and presents UI to the user. It generates a configuration file consisting of
enabled Kconfig symbols and parameter values (.ops-config) when user exits the
UI. Every time when UI is launched, saved set of user selected information is
picked up from existing .ops-config file.

.ops-config file is platform specific. This helps in preserving user choices
across platform selections. Symbolic links are used to facilitate this process.

### Kconfig files layout
------------------------
Kconfig files dictate the UI layout and dependencies between Kconfig Symbols.
These files follow standard kconfig language syntax. Following diagram shows
how Kconfig files are organized in OpenSwitch repository.

### Custom Scripts
------------------
In OpenSwitch, each repository is represented by a bitbake recipe and creates
a package. A feature can either directly map to a repository or a repository
can host multiple sub-features. The cases where a feature has a one to one
mapping with a repository, feature enable/disable is controlled by including/
excluding the corresponding package. IMAGE_FEATURES and FEATURE_PACKAGES
options of Yocto are used for this purpose. Yocto further works out package
dependency tree and includes/excludes all dependent packages both external
and OpenSwitch specific. In cases where a repository hosts multiple
sub-features or if a key-value parameter has to be passed on, build flags are
passed to repository level make environment.

The above tasks are handled by few custom scripts that run inside OpenSwitch
Yocto build as part of "make" target. A typical flow is summarized below:

* User runs "make menuconfig" and saves .ops-config
* User kicks off "make"
* Parse .ops-config. Enabled Kconfig symbols (=y) are added to IMAGE_FEATURES
* Check if enabled feature maps directly to a repository. If yes, then add
  FEATURE_PACKAGES and initialize it with one or more yocto packages
* If enabled feature doesn't map to any repository (i.e. a sub-feature), then
  modify repo specific recipe to pass relevant flags to make environment
* If a Kconfig symbol is a key-value pair, then modify repo specific recipes
  to pass relevant information to make environment

### OVSDB-Schema
----------------
Discuss enhacements to schema

### CIT Framework
-----------------
Discuss enhancements to CIT

## Design choices
-----------------
Following alternates were considered during the design:

### Mapping file
----------------
A centralized file which carries Kconfig symbol to yocto package mapping,
Kconfig symbol to schema entry mapping and Kconfig symbol to test scripts
mapping can be kept. Following disadvantages with the scheme:

* Additional manual step, prone to errors
* Mapping file can grow large and difficult to maintain
* For schema, mapping file closely resembles schema file duplicating work

### Repo level Kconfig files
----------------------------
Instead of keeping all Kconfig files in ops-build, spread them across repos
essentially keeping one Kconfig file per repo/feature. Following disadvantages
with the scheme:

* Increased build system complexity and reduced speed
* Loss of UI flexibility
* Loss of readability - of both Kconfig file tree and feature tree
* Tricky to handle certain cases like common feature sets, multiple implementations
  of same feature

### menuconfig for platform selection
-------------------------------------
Instead of "make configure"/"make switch-platform", use "make menuconfig" to
select platform. Following disadvantages with the scheme:

* Each platform has its own configuration file. So to load a configuration file,
  platform should be known
* Interactive process, not script friendly
* menuconfig is supposed to be an optional step and for most of the time, default
  configuration file should take care of feature sets
