### OpenSwitch Network Operating System Brings Open Source to DC Networking

The exponential rise in networking traffic driven by cloud data centers, big data analytics and mobile social media necessitates a new networking model that is able to support data centers into the future. It is no secret that the most successful businesses today are those that are the best at building and running the most data centers. Your data center is your business is a reality today. Running a reliable data center with great compute and storage resources requires an even better data center network.

Todayâ€™s vertically integrated networking model is not well suited for web-scale data centers. It lacks the ability to scale, utilizes outdated development and operating tools, is very manual, results in high costs, and worst of all is not that secure.

Network disaggregation is aimed at providing a new approach to networking that addresses the limitations of vertically integrated solutions by offering alternative solutions that separate the forwarding and control planes of the switch.

Network disaggregation offers customers the freedom to build their networking environments with the hardware and software component that best fit their requirements. The disaggregated solutions are usually built with streamlined hardware and software components that give customers higher scalability and offer then lower total cost of ownership.

The natural next step in the evolution of network disaggregation is the availability of an open source network operating system (NOS), which will usher in the dawn of true network disaggregation. With an open source OpenSwitch NOS, customers and developers can take control of their networking environments and better manage the costs associated with packaged software solutions.

OpenSwitch, an open source Linux-based NOS gives developers a modular, reliable, modern and fully featured L2/L3 operating system that enables them to use modern tools to build applications for their networks. Developers can utilize modern development tools to speed up the delivery of applications. All the modules of OpenSwitch are independent to ensure high availability and isolate problems from impacting other modules. OpenSwitch utilizes a central database that is used for communication among the various independent modules.

Users and developers are encouraged to join the openswitch.net community to take advantage of the benefits of OpenSwitch, to contribute to the community and to help guide the future direction of open source networking. We are proud that the openswitch initiative has started strong with the support of industry leading charter contributors, including HP, Accton, Broadcom, VMware, Intel and Qosmos. We look forward to seeing a vibrant openswitch community and welcome your contributions and your support.
