Openswitch Check_MK Agent
--------------------
[Check_MK][1] is an open source monitoring solution developed around [Nagios][2]. It provides monitoring of applications, operating systems and hardware for servers and networking elements. Openswitch's Check_MK Agent feature allows the ability for an Openswitch node to be monitored by Check_MK.

The Openswitch Check_MK Agent is a relatively small agent, based on the [Check_MK Linux Agent][3],  that runs system and OVSDB commands to gather system data to report to the Check_MK server.
