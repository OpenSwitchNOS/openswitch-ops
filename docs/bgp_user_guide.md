## Overview
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is most commonly used with the **inter-AS** (autonomous system) routing protocol. The latest BGP version is 4. **BGP-4** supports Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). The BGP advertises the routes based on destinations as an IP prefix and not the network "class" within BGP.

BGP is a **path-vector** protocol that provides routing information across various BGP routers that are exchanged using destination-based forwarding. For example:

The router sends packets based merely on the destination IP address carried in the IP header of the packet. In most cases, we have multiple routes to the same destination and then BGP decides which route to choose using the path attributes, such as *Shortest AS_Path, Multi_Exit_Disc (Multi-exit discriminator, or MED), Origin, Next_hop, Local_pref,* and so on.

BGP provides routing for routers or switches or both, that can be deployed in ISP, Enterprise, or data center environments.

## Setting up the basic configuration
The following is the minimum configuration needed to set up the BGP router. The AS number is unique to the Autonomous system and is used to distinguish between internal or external or both BGP connections. Enter the following commands in the order shown:

 1. The `router bgp` *`< asn >`* enables the BGP router for the AS number. The AS numbers range from 1 to 65535.
 2. Set the  BGP router-id:
 `bgp router-id` *`A.B.C.D`*.
 You can also disable the BGP router with the `no bgp router-id` *`A.B.C.D`* or `no bgp router-id`. The command defaults the router-id to 0.0.0.0.

Note: The `no router bgp` *`< asn >`* disables the BGP process with a given AS number.

## Setting up the optional configuration
To set up the optional configuration:

 1. Enter the router bgp command with the required AS number. For example:
 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*
    The *`router bgp < asn >`* command enables the BGP router for the AS number. The AS numbers range from 1 to 65535.

 2. Set the BGP router id:
 `bgp router-id` *`<A.B.C.D>`*
You can also disable the BGP router with the `no bgp router-id` *`A.B.C.D`* or `no bgp router-id`. This command defaults the router-id to 0.0.0.0.

 3.  Set up the maximum-paths:
 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `maximum-paths` *`< paths >`*.
The  Maximum number of paths limits the maximum number of paths for the BGP. If global ECMP is enabled and BGP maximum-paths is set greater than the global maximum-paths, then the global ECMP overrides BGP maximum-paths. If global ECMP is disabled then only the single best path is selected.
The `no maximum-paths` parameter defaults to the number of maximum paths and sets the value to "1".

 4. Set up the timers:
 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `timers bgp` *`< keepalive > < holdtime >`*.
The *`timers bgp < keepalive > < holdtime >`* sets the keepalive interval and holdtime timer for the BGP router.
Timers can be set to default with `no timers bgp` *`< keepalive > < holdtime >`*. The default keepalive interval is 180 seconds and holdtime is 60 seconds.

 5. To add the static network to the BGP routing table, enter the following command:
 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, *`network A.B.C.D/M`*.
 It announces the specified network to all peers in the AS. The `no network` *`A.B.C.D/M`* removes the announced network for this BGP router.

 6. Enter the following neighbor configuration commands in the order shown:
	 1. Define a new peer with `remote-as` *`< asn >`* and the *`< peer >`* as the IPv4 address: `router bgp` *`< asn >`*,  `neighbor` *`< peer >`* remote-as *`< asn >`*.
	 If remote-as is not configured, *bgpd* throws an error as *"canâ€™t find neighbor peer"*.
	 The `no neighbor peer` deletes the peer.
	 6. Set up the peer description:
	 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `neighbor` *`< peer >`* `description` *`< some_description>`*.
	 The `no  neighbor peer description` deletes the neighbor description info.
	 7. Enable MD5 authentication on a TCP connection between the BGP peers with the following command:
	 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `neighbor` *`< peer >`* `password` *`< some_password >`*.
	 The `no neighbor peer password` *`< some_password >`* disables MD5 authentication on the TCP connection between BGP peers.
	 8. Set up the keepalive interval or holdtime timer for a peer:
	   `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `neighbor peer timers` *`< keepalive > < holdtimer >`*.
	   The `no neighbor peer timers` *`< keepalive > < holdtimer >`* clears the keepalive interval and the holdtime timer for that peer.
	 9. Specify the number of times BGP allows an instance of AS to be in the AS_PATH with the following command:
	 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `neighbor peer allowas-in` *`< ASN_instances_allowed >`*.
	 The ASN_instances_allowed range is from 1 to 10.
	 The `no neighbor peer allowas-in` *`< ASN_instances_allowed >`* prevents the asn from being added to the AS_PATH by setting ASN_instances_allowed to '0'.
	 10. Remove private AS numbers from the AS path in the outbound routing updates: `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `neighbor peer remove-private-AS`.
	 The `no neighbor peer remove-private-AS` allows the private AS numbers from the AS path to be added to the outbound routing updates.
	 11. Enables a software-based reconfiguration to generate inbound updates from a neighbor without clearing the BGP session:
	 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `neighbor peer soft-reconfiguration inbound`.
	 The`no neighbor peer soft-reconfiguration inbound` disables the software-based reconfiguration.

 7. Peer-group is a collection of peers which share the same outbound policy. Neighbors belonging to the same peer-group might have different inbound policies. All peer commands are applicable to peer-group as well. The following are the peer-group configuration commands.

	Enter the following BGP Peer-Group commands in the order shown:

	 1. Define a new peer-group with *`< word >`* as the name of the peer-group:
	 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `neighbor` *`< word >`* `peer-group`.
	 The `neighbor` *`< word >`* `peer-group` deletes the peer-group.
	 2. Bind a specific peer to the peer-group provided:
	 `router bgp` *`< asn >`*, `neighbor peer peer-group word`.

 8. Enter the following peer filtering route map commands in the order shown:
 Configure the peer filtering route map for a given sequence number:
 `route-map` *`< word > (deny|permit) < sequence_num >`*.
 The variable < word > is a name of route map and the variable < sequence_num > range is from 1 to 65535. The `no route-map1` *`< word > (deny|permit) < sequence_num >`* deletes the route map. All route map commands should be executed under the  `route-map` *`< word > (deny|permit) < sequence_num >`* context.
Following are the route map configuration commands:
	1. Assign the route map to the peer for given direction:
	`route-map` *`< word > (deny|permit) < sequence_num >`* , `neighbor` *`< peer >`* `route-map` *`< word > in|out`*.
	The *`no neighbor < peer > route-map < word > in|out`* removes the route map from the peer.
	2. Add a route map description:
	`route-map` *`< word > (deny|permit) < sequence_num >`* , `description` *`< some_route_map_description>`*.
	The `no description` command removes the route map description.
	3. Assign or change community for the route map:
	`route-map` *`< word > (deny|permit) < sequence_num >`*, `set community` *`.AA:NN additive`*.
	The `no set community` *`.AA:NN additive`* command removes the community.
	4. Set or change the metric for the route map with the following command:
	`route-map* *`< word > (deny|permit) < sequence_num >`* , `set metric` *<0-4294967295>`*.
	You can use this command to overwrite the previously set metric. The `no set metric` *`<0-4294967295>`* resets the metric to `0`.

 9. Enter the following peer filtering ip perfix-list commands in the order shown:
		 1. Configure the ip prefix-list for given route map:
		 *`ip prefix-list < word > seq <1-4294967295>(deny|permit) (A.B.C.D/M|any)`*.
		 The *`no ip prefix-list < word > seq <1-4294967295> (deny|permit) (A.B.C.D/M|any)`* deletes the ip prefix-list for the given route map.
		 2. Configure prefix-list for match on given IP address:
		 *`match ip address prefix-list < word >`*.
		 The *`no match ip address prefix-list < word >`* removes the rule for match on ip address from the prefix-list.

## Verifying the configuration
Use the `show running-config` command to verify the configuration. All active configurations are displayed with the show running-config command. See the sample output below:

## Troubleshooting the configuration

The following commands verify the BGP route related information:

The `show ip bgp` verifies that all the routes are advertised from the peers.
