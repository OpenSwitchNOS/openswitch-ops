High level design of Management Interface
============================

The primary goal of the management module is to facilitate the management of device. It provides the following:

	•	Device access and configuration
	
	•	Event collection for monitoring, analysis, and correlation
	
	•	Device and user authentication, authorization, and accounting
	
	•	Device time synchronization
	
	•	Download image to device
	

The device is configured or monitored through the management interface. All management traffic like ssh to the device, tftp, etc goes through the management interface.
