<database title="OpenSwitch Configuration Database">
  <p>
    A database with this schema holds the configuration for one OpenSwitch
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The schema is derived from Open vSwitch schema.
    Tables/attributes which are not related to OpenSwitch first open source release
    (OSR1) were removed. Additionally the schema was extended to include OSR1
    features that don't exist in Open vSwitch, as well as information
    specific to a physical switch.
    Going forward, the expectation is to restore the Open vSwitch parts
    of the schema that were removed as we implement additional features.
  </p>
  <p>
    The top-level configuration is the
    <ref table="System"/> table, which must have exactly one
    record. Records that are not reachable from
    the <ref table="System"/> table are automatically deleted
    from the database, except for records in a few distinguished
    ``root set'' tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that a basic tenet of the OpenSwitch schema is that in the absence of any
    configuration, the default behavior of the OpenSwitch switch is such that
    no data traffic can be accepted or transmitted on any port or interface.
    Any future additions to the OpenSwitch schema must adhere to this principle.
  </p>

  <h2>Common Columns</h2>

  <p>
    Many tables contain two special columns, named <code>other_config</code>
    and <code>external_ids</code>. These columns have the same form and
    purpose each place that they appear, so we describe them here to save space
    later.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>other_config</code>: map of string-string pairs</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Key-value pairs for configuring rarely used features.  Supported keys,
        along with the forms taken by their values, are documented individually
        for each table.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few tables do not have <code>other_config</code> columns because no
        key-value pairs have yet been defined for them.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>external_ids</code>: map of string-string pairs</dt>
    <dd>
      Key-value pairs for use by external frameworks that integrate with OpenSwitch,
      rather than by OpenSwitch itself.  System integrators should
      either use the OpenSwitch development mailing list to coordinate on
      common key-value definitions, or choose key names that are likely to be
      unique.  In some cases, where key-value pairs have been defined that are
      likely to be widely useful, they are documented individually for each
      table.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Category</h2>

  <p>
    All columns in the schema, except those related to hardware configuration, include
    a "category" element. This element is used to define the data that is contained in
    the column.  There are three category types:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Status: Represent state data that the system writes as a result of its operation.
      The data can come from protocols or system daemons. Hardware information columns
      should use this category.  Columns using this category cannot be configured by
      the user.
    </li>
    <li>
      Statistics: Represent statistic data, usually counters, that the system reports.
      This data can come from protocols, hardware or system daemons.  Columns using
      this category cannot be configured by the user.
    </li>
    <li>
      Configuration: Represent configuration data that comes from the user.  Only columns
      using this category can be modified by the users.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Some column categories depend on the other column category. It means that the
    column category is not explicit. The value will be dynamically interpreted by taking
    the other column value. The tag "follows" inside the category is meant for that.
  </p>

  <p>
    In other cases the category must be interpreted using a specific row value itself.
    The column category will be calculated by mapping the specific enum value to the
    corresponding category. The tag "per-value" inside the category is meant for that.
  </p>

        These columns report the types and versions of the hardware and

          a non-backward compatible way (e.g. deleting a column or a table),
          <var>major</var> is incremented.  When the database schema is changed
          in a backward compatible way (e.g. adding a new column),
          <var>minor</var> is incremented.  When the database schema is changed
          cosmetically (e.g. reindenting its syntax), <var>tweak</var> is

          If there are primary controllers, removing all of them clears the
          flow table.  If there are no primary controllers, adding one also
          clears the flow table.  Other changes to the set of controllers, such
          as adding or removing a service controller, adding another primary
          controller to supplement an existing primary controller, or removing
          only one of two primary controllers, have no effect on the flow

      <column name="fail_mode">
        <p>When a controller is configured, it is, ordinarily, responsible
        for setting up all flows on the switch.  Thus, if the connection to
        the controller fails, no new network connections can be set up.
        If the connection to the controller stays down long enough,
        no packets can pass through the switch at all.  This setting
        determines the switch's response to such a situation.  It may be set
        to one of the following:
        <dl>
          <dt><code>standalone</code></dt>
          <dd>If no message is received from the controller for three
          times the inactivity probe interval
          (see <ref column="inactivity_probe"/>), then OpenSwitch
          will take over responsibility for setting up flows.  In
          this mode, OpenSwitch causes the bridge to act like an
          ordinary MAC-learning switch.  OpenSwitch will continue
          to retry connecting to the controller in the background
          and, when the connection succeeds, it will discontinue its
          standalone behavior.</dd>
          <dt><code>secure</code></dt>
          <dd>OpenSwitch will not set up flows on its own when the
          controller connection fails or when no controllers are
          defined.  The bridge will continue to retry connecting to
          any defined controllers forever.</dd>
        </dl>
        </p>
        <p>
          The default is <code>standalone</code> if the value is unset, but
          future versions of OpenSwitch may change the default.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>standalone</code> mode can create forwarding loops on a
          bridge that has more than one uplink port unless STP is enabled.  To
          avoid loops on such a bridge, configure <code>secure</code> mode or
          enable STP (see <ref column="stp_enable"/>).

        <p>When more than one controller is configured,
        <ref column="fail_mode"/> is considered only when none of the

        <p>

        <p>
          A short MAC aging time allows a network to more quickly detect that a
          host is no longer connected to a switch port.  However, it also makes
          it more likely that packets will be flooded unnecessarily, when they
          are addressed to a connected host that rarely transmits packets.  To
          reduce the incidence of unnecessary flooding, use a MAC aging time
          longer than the maximum interval at which a host will ordinarily
          transmit packets.

        In the default mode, a Backup router coming up with a higher priority than another
        Backup that is currently operating as Master will take over the Master function.
        When the mode is disabled, the protocol prevents higher-priority Backup from taking
        over the Master operation from a lower-priority Backup.
        This mode does not prevent an Owner router from resuming the Master function after
        recovering from being unavailable. Also, the VR instance must be disabled

        Specifies a virtual IPv4 or IPv6 address for the VR instance. For an owner, the virtual IP
        must be one of the IP addresses configured on the interface for that VR. For a backup,
        the virtual IP must match the virtual IP of the owner. The owner and the backups using a given
        virtual IP must all belong to the same network or subnet.
        For IPv6, VR's first address should be link local address. After the primary link local
        IPv6 address is configured on the VR, user can add the global IPv6 addresses.

        This column, also specifies the interface's IP address to designate as the source for
        VRRP advertisements from the VR. By default lowest interface's IP address is used as
        source for VRRP advertisements. Source IP configuration parameter is for IPv4 only.
        IPv6 doesn't have a source IP address configuration parameter.
        For IPv6, the source IP address is the link-local address of the real interface over
        which the packet is transmitted.
      </column>
      <column name="ip_address_secondary">

        Specifies a time in seconds that this router will wait before taking control
        of the virtual IP address that will allow it to route packets.
        Default is <code>0</code> seconds.

        In normal VRRP operation, one router(say Router-1) is in the Master state
        and one router (Router-2) is in the Backup state. Router-1 provides the
        default gateway for the hosts. If Router-1 goes down for any reason, the
        Backup router, Router-2, provides the default gateway for the host. When
        Router-1 comes back on line (fail-back), it takes control of the VIP, and
        begins sending out VRRP advertisement packets at regular intervals. The
        backup router receives the VRRP advertisements and transitions to the backup
        state.

        When OSPF is also enabled on the routers and a fail-back event occurs, the
        master router immediately takes control of the VIP and provides the default
        gateway functionality. If the OSPF has not converged, the route table in the
        master router may not be completely populated. When hosts send packets to the
        default gateway, the master router may not know where to send them and packets
        may be dropped.

        The Preempt Delay Timer allows user to configure a period of time before the
        VR takes control of the VIP. It doesn't transition to master state until the timer
        period expires.

        ownership of the VR instance. Allowed values are <code>enable_with_no_monitoring</code>,
        <code>enable_with_monitoring</code>, <code>disable</code>.
        Failover operation involves handing off the VR's control of the virtual IP to another
        VR. Once a failover is enabled, the VR begins sending advertisements with priority
        zero instead of the configured priority. When the VR detects a peer VR taking control, it
        releases control of the virtual IP and ceases VR operation until a failback is executed.
        Failover occurs on only a backup VR operating as master.
        If failover is enabled with monitoring option, the VR continues to monitor the virtual IP
        after ceasing VR operation. If the master VR goes down, it then retakes control of the
        virtual IP.
        Default value is <code>disable</code>.

  <table name="VRRP_Track_Entity" title="VRRP track entity info">
    <p>
        This represents information regarding entities such as ports tracked by
        VRRP virtual routers .
        This feature provides the ability to dynamically change the priority of
        the virtual router(VR) when tracked entities such as ports go down.
        In normal VRRP operation, one router(say Router-1) is in the Master state
        and one router (Router-2) is in the Backup state. Router-1 provides the default
        gateway for the hosts. If Router-1 goes down for any reason, the Backup router,
        Router-2, provides the default gateway for the host.
        If all the tracked entities configured on Router-1 go down, Router-1 begins sending
        advertisements with a priority of zero. This causes Router-2 to take control of the
        virtual IP.
        A Backup VR switches to priority zero instead of its configured value when all its
        tracked entities go down. An Owner VR always uses priority <code>255</code> and
        never relinquishes control voluntarily.

      The table's name.  Set this column to change the name that controllers
      will receive when they request table statistics, e.g. <code>ovs-ofctl
      dump-tables</code>.  The name does not affect switch behavior.

    <group title="Eviction Policy">
      <p>
        OpenSwitch supports limiting the number of flows that may be
        installed in a flow table, via the <ref column="flow_limit"/> column.
        When adding a flow would exceed this limit, by default OpenSwitch
        reports an error, but there are two ways to configure OpenSwitch to
        instead delete (``evict'') a flow to make room for the new one:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Set the <ref column="overflow_policy"/> column to <code>evict</code>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Send an OpenFlow 1.4+ ``table mod request'' to enable eviction for
          the flow table (e.g. <code>ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow14 mod-table br0 0
          evict</code> to enable eviction on flow table 0 of bridge
          <code>br0</code>).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When a flow must be evicted due to overflow, the flow to evict is
        chosen through an approximation of the following algorithm.  This
        algorithm is used regardless of how eviction was enabled:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Divide the flows in the table into groups based on the values of the
          fields or subfields specified in the <ref column="groups"/> column,
          so that all of the flows in a given group have the same values for
          those fields.  If a flow does not specify a given field, that field's
          value is treated as 0.  If <ref column="groups"/> is empty, then all
          of the flows in the flow table are treated as a single group.
        </li>

        <li>
          Consider the flows in the largest group, that is, the group that
          contains the greatest number of flows.  If two or more groups all
          have the same largest number of flows, consider the flows in all of
          those groups.
        </li>

        <li>
          If the flows under consideration have different importance values,
          eliminate from consideration any flows except those with the lowest
          importance.  (``Importance,'' a 16-bit integer value attached to each
          flow, was introduced in OpenFlow 1.4.  Flows inserted with older
          versions of OpenFlow always have an importance of 0.)
        </li>

        <li>
          Among the flows under consideration, choose the flow that expires
          soonest for eviction.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The eviction process only considers flows that have an idle timeout
        or a hard timeout.  That is, eviction never deletes permanent flows.
        (Permanent flows do count against <ref column="flow_limit"/>.)
      </p>

      <column name="flow_limit">
        If set, limits the number of flows that may be added to the table.
        OpenSwitch may limit the number of flows in a table for other
        reasons, e.g. due to hardware limitations or for resource availability
        or performance reasons.

        on a host.
      </column>

      <group title="OpenFlow Port Number">
        <p>
          When a client adds a new interface, OpenSwitch chooses an OpenFlow
          port number for the new port.  If the client that adds the port fills
          in <ref column="ofport_request"/>, then OpenSwitch tries to use its
          value as the OpenFlow port number.  Otherwise, or if the requested
          port number is already in use or cannot be used for another reason,
          OpenSwitch automatically assigns a free port number.  Regardless of
          how the port number was obtained, OpenSwitch then reports in <ref
          column="ofport"/> the port number actually assigned.
        </p>

        <p>
          OpenSwitch limits the port numbers that it automatically assigns to
          the range 1 through 32,767, inclusive.  Controllers therefore have
          free use of ports 32,768 and up.

        <column name="ofport">
          <p>

          <p>
            The OpenFlow ``local'' port (<code>OFPP_LOCAL</code>) is 65,534.
            The other valid port numbers are in the range 1 to 65,279,
            inclusive.  Value -1 indicates an error adding the interface.

          </p>

          <p>
            A client should ideally set this column's value in the same
            database transaction that it uses to create the interface.  OpenSwitch 
            will honor a later request for a
            specific port number, although it might confuse some controllers:
            OpenFlow does not have a way to announce a port number change, so
            OpenSwitch represents it over OpenFlow as a port deletion
            followed immediately by a port addition.

          drops.  The <ref table="Bridge" column="fail_mode"/> column in the
          <ref table="Bridge"/> table applies to primary controllers.
        </p>

        <p>
          OpenSwitch permits a bridge to have any number of primary
          controllers.  When multiple controllers are configured, OpenSwitch 
          connects to all of them simultaneously.  Because
          OpenFlow 1.0 does not specify how multiple controllers
          coordinate in interacting with a single switch, more than
          one primary controller should be specified only if the
          controllers are themselves designed to coordinate with each
          other.  (The Nicira-defined <code>NXT_ROLE</code> OpenFlow
          vendor extension may be useful for this.)

          These kinds of OpenFlow controller connections are intended for
          occasional support and maintenance use, e.g. with
          <code>ovs-ofctl</code>.  Usually a service controller connects only
          briefly to inspect or modify some of a switch's state.
        </p>

        <p>
          OpenSwitch listens for incoming connections from service
          controllers.  The service controllers initiate and, if necessary,
          maintain the connections from their end.  The <ref table="Bridge"
          column="fail_mode"/> column in the <ref table="Bridge"/> table does
          not apply to service controllers.

        OpenFlow switches send certain messages to controllers spontanenously,

        asynchronous messages to be limited or disabled to ensure the best use
        of network resources.
      </p>

      <column name="enable_async_messages">
        The OpenFlow protocol enables asynchronous messages at time of
        connection establishment, which means that a controller can receive
        asynchronous messages, potentially many of them, even if it turns them
        off immediately after connecting.  Set this column to
        <code>false</code> to change OpenSwitch behavior to disable, by
        default, all asynchronous messages.  The controller can use the
        <code>NXT_SET_ASYNC_CONFIG</code> Nicira extension to OpenFlow to turn
        on any messages that it does want to receive, if any.
      </column>

      <group title="Controller Rate Limiting">
        <p>
          A switch can forward packets to a controller over the OpenFlow
          protocol.  Forwarding packets this way at too high a rate can
          overwhelm a controller, frustrate use of the OpenFlow connection for
          other purposes, increase the latency of flow setup, and use an
          unreasonable amount of bandwidth.  Therefore, OpenSwitch supports
          limiting the rate of packet forwarding to a controller.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are two main reasons in OpenFlow for a packet to be sent to a
          controller: either the packet ``misses'' in the flow table, that is,
          there is no matching flow, or a flow table action says to send the
          packet to the controller.  OpenSwitch limits the rate of each kind
          of packet separately at the configured rate.  Therefore, the actual
          rate that packets are sent to the controller can be up to twice the
          configured rate, when packets are sent for both reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
          This feature is specific to forwarding packets over an OpenFlow
          connection.  It is not general-purpose QoS.  See the <ref
          table="QoS"/> table for quality of service configuration.
        </p>

        <column name="controller_rate_limit">
          <p>
            The maximum rate at which the switch will forward packets to the
            OpenFlow controller, in packets per second.  If no value is
            specified, rate limiting is disabled.
          </p>
        </column>

        <column name="controller_burst_limit">
          <p>
            When a high rate triggers rate-limiting, OpenSwitch queues
            packets to the controller for each port and transmits them to the
            controller at the configured rate.  This value limits the number of
            queued packets.  Ports on a bridge share the packet queue fairly.
          </p>

          <p>
            This value has no effect unless <ref
            column="controller_rate_limit"/> is configured.  The current
            default when this value is not specified is one-quarter of <ref
            column="controller_rate_limit"/>, meaning that queuing can delay
            forwarding a packet to the controller by up to 250 ms.
